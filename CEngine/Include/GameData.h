	///
	/// The GameData class acts as storage for all main data related to the current game-state, like storing all active game objects
	/// in the game, data on the current level and so on. It will also house when appropriate other information designed to work on the
	/// game-state, such as BSP-trees for collision. It is designed to be interfaced with by Game States (and others) to work on the current
	/// game state.
	/// It provides Begin() and End() functions to use for iterating through GameObjects without needing access to the collections themselves.

		/// such this constructor imposes the restriction that the list of objects waiting to be removed on the other GameData instance
		/// MUST be empty prior to copying.
