	/// \brief Abstract class used as a base to create implementation State classes.
	///
	/// The State class is an abstract class to use as a base for any class you wish to use in a StateMachine. These classes
	/// must naturally define the implementation of their State be it game logic or other behaviours.
	/// When a State is entered to via StateMachine::ChangeState(), the Enter method is called to perform any setup.
	/// The Update method is designed to be called as part of a main loop to perform the required logic for a game.
	/// The Exit method is called when the StateMachine is entering into another State, to perform any necessary clean-up.
